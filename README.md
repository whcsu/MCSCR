# A Semiparametric subdistribution hazard mixture cure model for competing credit risks

Due to the coexistence of long-term event-free survivors and competing risk, expanding the competing risks model to incorporate a cure fraction is an important issue in credit scoring. In this study, we propose a mixture cure model with subdistribution competing risks to analyse the competing risks data with a cure fraction, permitting us to directly estimate the effect of covariates on the cure rate and the cumulative incidence function of uncured individuals. We propose a corresponding Expectation-Maximum algorithm to estimate the parameters and design a simulation algorithm to generate competing risks data with a cure fraction. Through simulated  and real world credit scoring datasets, we show that the proposed estimator performs well and the proposed model shows better prediction performance compared to other competing methods
